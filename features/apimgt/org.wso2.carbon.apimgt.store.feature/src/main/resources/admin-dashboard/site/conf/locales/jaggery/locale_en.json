These alerts could be treated as an indication of a slow backend.In technical terms, if the backend time of a particular API resource (eg: GET /calc/1.0/numbers) of a tenant, lies outside the Xth percentile value, we will send an alert out. Default percentile value is 95%. Here, we safely assume that the corresponding backend time of an API resource follows a normal distribution. Percentile value gets calculated daily by default. ",

    "abnormalResponseTime_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a sudden increase of the response time of a particular API resource. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a slow WSO2 API Manager runtime or a slow backend. ",

    "abnormalRequestsPerMin_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a sudden spike or a drop in the request count within a period of one minute by default for a particular API resource. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a possible high traffic or suspicious act or possible malfunction of the client application etc.",

These alerts could be treated as an indication of a suspicious activity done by a user over an API of an application. ",

    "AbnormalRefreshAlert_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a change in the pattern of renewing access tokens of an application by a user. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a stolen access token.",
