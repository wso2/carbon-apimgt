    "abnormalBackendTime_Desc": "This alert type should get triggered if there is a sudden increase of the backend time corresponds to a particular API resource. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a slow backend.In technical terms, if the backend time of a particular API resource (eg: GET /calc/1.0/numbers) of a tenant, lies outside the Xth percentile value, we will send an alert out. Default percentile value is 95%. Here, we safely assume that the corresponding backend time of an API resource follows a normal distribution. Percentile value gets calculated daily by default. ",

    "abnormalResponseTime_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a sudden increase of the response time of a particular API resource. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a slow WSO2 API Manager runtime or a slow backend. ",

    "abnormalRequestsPerMin_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a sudden spike or a drop in the request count within a period of one minute by default for a particular API resource. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a possible high traffic or suspicious act or possible malfunction of the client application etc.",

These alerts could be treated as an indication of a suspicious activity done by a user over an API of an application. ",

    "AbnormalRefreshAlert_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if there is a change in the pattern of renewing access tokens of an application by a user. These alerts could be treated as an indication of a stolen access token.",

    "FrequentTierHittingAlert_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if at least one of the two cases below satisfied; If a particular application gets throttled out for hitting the subscribed tier limit of that application, more than 10 times (by default) within a day (by default) or If a particular user of an application, gets throttled out for hitting the subscribed tier limit of a particular API, more than 10 times (by default) within a day (by default)",

    "AbnormalTierUsage_Desc":"This alert should get triggered if there is a drastic reduction in API usage for a given API for a given user. These type of alerts should be treated as an indication of a failure of the application which is using the altered API.",

    "healthAvailabilityPerMin_Desc":"This alert type should get triggered if at least one of the three cases below satisfied;  Response time of an API > Response time upper percentile of that particular API or Request Count of an API per minute > Request count per minute lower percentile or Response status code >= 500 (By Default) AND Response status code < 600 (By Default)",
