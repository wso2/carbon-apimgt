        TODO the following code is a hack to get past the fact that Path and Response are not interfaces, it can be deleted as part of the refactor to make Path and Response interfaces
        pathMapper and responseMapper are ObjectMappers that are only going to be used during deserialization of Paths and Responses.
        We need them because:
         1) RefPath extends Path
         2) RefResponse extends Response
         And when we detect we are deserializing a "normal" Path or Response (e.g. its not a ref) we need skip
         the PathDeserializer and ResponseDeserializer logic, lest we get into a stack overflow problem
