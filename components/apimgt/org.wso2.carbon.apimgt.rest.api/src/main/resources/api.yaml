            ** Search condition **.


            If no advanced attribute modifier is found search will match the
            given query string against API Name.


            You can search in attributes by using **"attribute:"** modifier.


            Eg. "provider:wso2" will match if the API provider is wso2.


            Supported attribute modifiers are [ **version, context, status,
            description, subcontext, doc, provider, tag **  ]

            If no advanced attribute modifier is found search will match the
            given query string against Tag Name.



            You can search in attributes by using **"attribute:"** modifier.



            Eg. "apiName:phoneVerification" will match if the API Name is
            phoneVerification.



            Supported attribute modifiers are [ **apiName,version**  ]
