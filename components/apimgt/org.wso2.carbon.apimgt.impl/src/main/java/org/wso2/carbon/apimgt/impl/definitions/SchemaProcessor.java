 * Interface for processing OpenAPI schema objects when constructing API product OpenAPI definition.
 * Implementations of this interface handle the extraction and processing of references from schema definitions
 * in OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications while performing the conversion from source Schema OpenAPI version to resulting
 * API Product's OpenAPI version.
 * The primary use case is to parse complex schema structures such as:
 * - {allOf}, {anyOf}, {oneOf} composed schemas
 * - Mapped schemas with additional properties
 * - Object and array schemas
 * - Schema references within/without properties
