    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>WSO2 API Manager is a complete solution for publishing APIs, creating and managing a developer community, and
        for scalably routing API traffic. It leverages proven, production-ready, integration, security and
        governance components from WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus, WSO2 Identity Server, and WSO2 Governance Registry.
        Moreover, it is powered by WSO2 Business Activity Monitor, thereby making WSO2 API Manager ready for any
        large-scale deployments right away.
    </p>

    <p>
        As part of its latest release, the REST API was developed as a CXF REST web application running on WSO2 API
        Manager. This API comes with a pluggable security mechanism. Since API security is implemented as a CXF
        handler, if you need to plug a custom security mechanism, you can write your own handler and add it to the
        web service. This REST API is implemented based on REST best practices and specifications. API development
        is started with a swagger specification for Store and Publisher operations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before invoking the API with the access token, obtain the consumer key/secret key pair by calling the
        dynamic client registration endpoint. You can request an access token with the preferred grant type. An
        example is shown below,
    </p>

    <div class="pre"><code class="bash">curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @payload.json http://localhost:9763/client-registration/v0.9/register</code></div>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Sample request:
    </p>

    <div class="pre"><code class="json">{
    "callbackUrl": "www.google.lk",
    "clientName": "rest_api_store",
    "tokenScope": "Production",
    "owner": "admin",
    "grantType": "password refresh_token",
    "saasApp": true
}</code></div>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Sample response:
    </p>

    <div class="pre"><code class="json">{
    "callBackURL": "www.google.lk",
    "jsonString":
    "{
    \"username\":\"admin\",
    \"redirect_uris\":\"www.google.lk\",
    \"tokenScope\":[Ljava.lang.String;@3a73796a,
    \"client_name\":\"admin_rest_api_store\",
    \"grant_types\":\"authorization_code password refresh_token iwa:ntlm
    urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer client_credentialsimplicit\"
    }",
    "clientName": null,
    "clientId": "HfEl1jJPdg5tbtrxhAwybN05QGoa",
    "clientSecret": "l6c0aoLcWR3fwezHhc7XoGOht5Aa"
}</code></div>
    <br/>

    <p>
        During the API invocation process request, click the CXF handler first, which calls an introspection API to
        validate the token. Generate the access token using the already created OAuth application. A sample call to
        generate the access token is shown below.
    </p>

    <div class="pre"><code class="bash">curl -k -d "grant_type=password&username=admin&password=admin&scope=apim:subscribe" -H "Authorization: Basic SGZFbDFqSlBkZzV0YnRyeGhBd3liTjA1UUdvYTpsNmMwYW9MY1dSM2Z3ZXpIaGM3WG9HT2h0NUFh" https://127.0.0.1:8243/token</code></div>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Token response:
    </p>

    <div class="pre"><code class="json">{
    "scope":"apim:subscribe",
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "expires_in":3600,
    "refresh_token":"33c3be152ebf0030b3fb76f2c1f80bf8",
    "access_token":"292ff0fd256814536baca0926f483c8d"
}</code></div>
    <br/>

    <p>
        Now you have a valid access token, which you can use to invoke an API. Navigate through the API descriptions
        to find the required API, obtain an access token as described above and invoke the API with the
        authentication header. If you use a different authentication mechanism, this process may change.
    </p>
