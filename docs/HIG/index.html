        <p>This document has been produced as a set of guidelines to ensure a rich user
            experience for end users of the API Manager app. </p>

            <h3>User Roles</h3>
            <h4>API Publisher</h4>
            <p>
                An API publisher (API provider) is an API product manager. He/she manages a set of APIs and API
                products across the enterprise or business unit and controls the API lifecycle, subscriptions,
                and monetization aspects of an API or API product. The API Publisher can also analyze usage patterns
                for APIs and access all APIs statistics.
            </p>
            <h4>API Creator</h4>
            <p>
                An API Creator is a person in a technical role who understands the technical aspects of the API
                (interfaces, documentation, versions, etc.) and uses the API Publisher portal for the design and
                development of APIs. APIs created by an API creator are managed (lifecycle managed and productized)
                by an API product manager.
            </p>
            <h4>API Subscriber</h4>
            <p>
                A subscriber is a consumer of an API. He/she intends to develop one or more applications that consume
                APIs on the developer portal. A subscriber uses the API developer portal to discover APIs, read the
                documentation and forums, rate/comment on the APIs, subscribe, obtain keys, and finally use APIs
                from their applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Admin</h4>
            <p>
                The admin user is responsible for managing the admin portal, which includes tasks such as approving
                workflows, managing rate limiting policies, configuring emails for bot detection/alerts, viewing the
                state and health of APIs, etc. In addition, the admin user is also capable of carrying out general
                administrative tasks such as managing users, roles, databases, security, etc.

                    <p>
                        Paper prototyping is the process of creating rough, often hand-sketched, drawings of a user
                        interface, and using them in a usability test to gather feedback.
                        Participants point to locations on the page that they would click, and screens are manually
                        presented to the user based on the interactions they indicate.

            <h3>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h3>
            <p>A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method mainly used to identify any design issues
                associated with the user interface.</p>
            <p>Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics are probably the most-used usability heuristics for user interface design.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Visibility of system status</b>
                    <p>
                        The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate
                        feedback within reasonable time.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Match between system and the real world</b>
                    <p>
                        The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the
                        user, rather than system-oriented terms.
                        Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>User control and freedom</b>
                    <p>
                        Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked
                        "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
                        Support undo and redo.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Consistency and standards</b>
                    <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same
                        thing. Follow platform conventions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Error prevention</b>
                    <p>
                        Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring
                        in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users
                        with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Recognition rather than recall</b>
                    <p>
                        Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should
                        not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another.
                        Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Flexibility and efficiency of use</b>
                    <p>Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert
                        user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to
                        tailor frequent actions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Aesthetic and minimalist design</b>
                    <p>
                        Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit
                        of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
                        their relative visibility.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</b>
                    <p>
                        Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem,
                        and constructively suggest a solution.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Help and documentation</b>
                    <p>
                        Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary
                        to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on
                        the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
                    </p>

            <h3>Fitts's Law</h3>
            <p>The time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to
                the target and the size of the target
            </p>
            <img width="600" src="assets/images/fittsLaw.png" alt="Fitts Law"/>
            <p>Eg. Buttons to complete an action should be close beside active elements. Important actions should be
                larger so they’re easier to select.

            <h3>Hick’s Law</h3>
            <p>The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of options increases.
            </p>
            <p>Simplify choices for the user by breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps.
                Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting the recommended options.
                Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users.

            <p>
                Eg. If there are too many options in a dropdown, users will most likely go through all the options and
                the decision time increases.
                Also if there is too much information to gather, it's better to use a stepper and collect the
                information step by step.
